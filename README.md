# Introduction

### What is the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder?

The Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder is a voluntary
self-assessment tool that enables organizations to better understand the
effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management efforts. It helps
leaders of organizations identify opportunities for improvement based on
their cybersecurity needs and objectives, as well as their larger
organizational needs, objectives, and outcomes.

Using this self-assessment, you can:
- determine cybersecurity-related activities that are important to your business strategy and critical service delivery;
- prioritize your investments in managing cybersecurity risk;
- determine how best to enable your workforce, customers, suppliers, partners, and collaborators to be risk conscious and security aware, and to fulfill their cybersecurity roles and responsibilities;
- assess the effectiveness and efficiency of your use of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices;
- assess the cybersecurity results you achieve; and
- identify priorities for improvement.

Like the [Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity](http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/upload/cybersecurity-framework-021214.pdf)
(*Cybersecurity Framework*) and the [Baldrige
Excellence](https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/baldrige-excellence-framework)
[Framework
,](https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/baldrige-excellence-framework)
the *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* is not a one-size-fits-all
approach. It is adaptable and scalable to your organization's needs,
goals, capabilities, and environment. It does not prescribe how you
should structure your organization's cybersecurity policies and
operations. Through interrelated sets of open-ended questions, it
encourages you to use the approaches that best fit your organization.

### What is the relationship between the *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* and the *Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity*?

The *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* blends the systems
perspective of the Baldrige Excellence Framework with the Cybersecurity
Framework.

The *Cybersecurity Framework* assembles and organizes standards,
guidelines, and practices that are working effectively in many
organizations. In the Baldrige approach as applied to cybersecurity,
an organization manages all areas affected by cybersecurity as a unified
whole. As shown in the diagram below, the system consists of your
cybersecurity-related approaches in the areas of leadership, strategy,
customers, workforce, and operations, as well as the results you
achieve. The system foundation is measurement, analysis, and
knowledge management. The background for all of these components is the
Organizational Context. In this set of questions, you define your
organization's distinctive characteristics and situation as they
relate to cybersecurity.

![IO](baldrige-page-5_I0.jpg)

The *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* incorporates the content
outlined in the Cybersecurity Framework into those system elements. The
table in the Appendix shows how the items in the *Baldrige Cybersecurity
Excellence Builder* relate to the elements of the *Cybersecurity Framework*.

### Who in an organization should use the *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder*?

The *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* is intended for use by the
leaders and managers in your organization who are concerned with and

### How can organizations use the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder to assess and improve their management of cybersecurity risks?

There are 17 items (plus 2 in Organizational Context ), each with a
particular focus. These items are divided into three groups according
to the kinds of information they ask for :

- The Organizational Context asks you to define the organizational environment that informs your cybersecurity risk management program.
- Process items (categories 1 – 6 ) ask you to define your organization’s processes relating to cybersecurity risk management.
- Results items (category 7 ) ask you to report results for your organization's cybersecurity-related processes. 
- The Assessment Rubric (page 25 ) helps you evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of your cybersecurity-related processes, as well as the quality of your cybersecurity-related results and how they work together as a system.

Here is how you might use the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder
in a self-assessment of your organization's cybersecurity-related work.

#### 1. Decide on the scope of your self-assessment.

The *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder* is most valuable as a
voluntary assessment of an entire organization's cybersecurity risk
management program, but it is also useful in assessing a subunit,
multiple subunits, or parts of an organization.

#### 2. Complete the Organizational Context.
The Organizational Context section is critically important for the following reasons :

- It helps you identify gaps in key information and focus on key cybersecurity performance requirements and results.
- You can use it as an initial self-assessment. If you identify topics for which conflicting, little, or no information is available, use these topics for action planning.
- It sets the context for and allows you to address unique aspects of your organization's cybersecurity-related needs in your responses to the questions in the rest of the *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder*.

#### 3. Answer the process questions in categories 1 – 6.
Many of the questions begin with “ how.” In answering these “ how ”
questions, give information on your organization's key
cybersecurity-related processes :

- *Approach* : How do you accomplish your organization's cybersecurity-related work? How systematic are the key processes you use?
- *Deployment* : How consistently are your key cybersecurity-related processes used in relevant parts of your organization?
- *Learning* : Have you evaluated and improved your key cybersecurity-related processes? Have improvements been shared within your organization?
- *Integration* : How do your cybersecurity-related processes address your
current and future organizational needs?

#### 4. Answer the results questions in category 7.
For these five items, give information on the cybersecurity-related
results that are the most important to your organization's success :

- *Levels* : For your key measures of the effectiveness and efficiency of cybersecurity-related processes, what is your current performance?
- *Trends* : Are the results improving, staying the same, or getting worse?
- *Comparisons* : How does your performance compare with that of other organizations and competitors, or with benchmarks?
- *Integration* : Are you tracking cybersecurity-related results that are important to your organization and consider the expectations and needs of your key stakeholders? Are you using the results in decision-making? 3

#### 5. Assign a descriptor to your responses to each item.

Using the process and results assessment rubrics on pages 25 and 26,
assign a descriptor (Reactive, Early, Mature, or Role Model ) to
your responses.

#### 6. Prioritize your actions.

Celebrate the strengths of your cybersecurity risk management program,
and build on them to improve what you do well. Sharing what you do well
with the rest of your organization can speed improvement.

Also prioritize your opportunities for improving your
cybersecurity-related processes and results; you cannot do everything
at once. Think about what is most important for your organization as a
whole at this time, balancing the differing needs and expectations of
your stakeholders and your expected results, and decide what to work on
first.

#### 7. Develop an action plan, implement it, and measure and evaluate your progress.

As you respond to the questions and gauge your responses against the
rubric, you will begin to identify strengths and gaps — first within
the categories and then among them. The coordination of key processes,
and linkages between your processes and your results, can lead to
cycles of improvement. As you continue to use this assessment tool,
you will learn more and more about your organization and begin to define
the best ways to build on your strengths, close gaps, and innovate.
Completing this voluntary self-assessment might also serve as a first
step in carrying out these suggestions in the Cybersecurity Framework,
section 3.0 (“How to Use the Framework”):

- 3.1 Basic Review of Cybersecurity Processes : Use the information gained from answering the self-assessment questions to compare your current cybersecurity activities with those outlined in the *Cybersecurity Framework* Core.
- 3.2 Establishing or Improving a Cybersecurity Program : Use your answers to the self-assessment questions to inform the steps in creating or improving a cybersecurity program (see also the Appendix ).
- 3.3 Communicating Cybersecurity Requirements with Stakeholders : Your answers to the questions might inform the creation of a Target Profile to express cybersecurity risk management requirements to stakeholders.

(1) Your organization needs to know where it stands relative to
competitors and to best practices; (2) comparative information and
information obtained from benchmarking often provide the impetus for
significant improvement or transformational change; (3) comparing
performance information frequently leads to a better understanding of
your processes and their performance; (4) data on competitors ’
performance may reveal organizational advantages as well as challenge
areas; and - (5 ) comparative information may support business analysis
and decisions relating to core competencies, partnering, and
outsourcing.

**C.2c.** Your performance improvement system refers to your overall
approach to improving processes and projects within your organization.
The approach you use should be related to your organization's needs.

**Notes:**

**1.1.** In this item, “ leaders ” includes your organization's senior
leaders and those specifically responsible for overseeing and executing
cybersecurity risk management and operations. Leadership on
cybersecurity policies and approaches ideally resides at multiple
organizational levels. Your organization should decide whether each
question refers to all senior leaders or your cybersecurity leaders.

**Q4.** To build successful cybersecurity policies and operations that are
successful now and in the future, leaders should create an environment
for improvement and learning; create a workforce culture that fosters
engagement in cybersecurity matters; and create an environment for
innovation and intelligent risk taking, achievement of your
cybersecurity strategic objectives, and operational agility.

might involve key suppliers, distributors, partners, and customers in
your strategy development.

**Q3.** Innovation refers to making meaningful change to improve products /
services, processes, or organizational effectiveness and create new
value for stakeholders. Innovation involves adopting an idea, process
, technology, product, or business model that is either new or new to
its proposed application. The outcome of innovation is a discontinuous
or “ breakthrough ” change in results, products / services, or
processes. Innovation benefits from a supportive environment, a
process for identifying strategic opportunities, and a willingness to
pursue intelligent risks.

**Q4.** The data and information you collect and analyze might relate to
current and future cybersecurity risks locally, nationally, and
globally; requirements for and strengths and weaknesses of your

## 3 Customers

### 3.1 Voice of the Customer : How do you obtain information from your customers?

In your response, include answers to the following questions. Assess
your response using the process rubric on page 25.

- (1) HOW do you listen to, interact with, and observe internal and external CUSTOMERS to obtain actionable information?

- (2) HOW do you determine internal and external CUSTOMERS’ satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and ENGAGEMENT with your organization’s CYBERSECURITY policies and operations?

**Notes:**

**3.1.** The voice of the customer refers to your process for capturing
customer-related information. Voice-of-the-customer processes are
intended to be proactive and continuously innovative so that they
capture stated, unstated, and anticipated customer requirements,
expectations, and desires. The goal is customer engagement. In
listening to the voice of the customer, you might gather and integrate
various types of customer data, such as survey data, focus group
findings, blog comments and data from other social media, warranty
data, marketing and sales information, and complaint data that affect
customers'purchasing and engagement decisions.

**Q2.** You might use any or all of the following to determine customer
satisfaction and dissatisfaction : surveys, formal and informal
feedback, customer account histories, complaints, field reports, win
/ loss analysis, customer referral rates, and transaction completion
rates. You might gather information on the web, through personal
contact or a third party, or by mail. Determining customer
dissatisfaction should be seen as more than reviewing low customer
satisfaction scores. Dissatisfaction should be independently determined
to identify root causes and enable a systematic remedy to avoid future
dissatisfaction.

**Q3.** Information on relative customer satisfaction may include
comparisons with competitors, comparisons with other organizations that
deliver similar products / services in a noncompetitive marketplace, or
comparisons obtained through trade or other organizations. Information
obtained on relative customer satisfaction may also include information
on why customers choose your competitors over you.

### 3.2 Customer Engagement : How do you engage customers by serving their needs and building relationships?

In your response, include answers to the following questions. Assess
your response using the process rubric on page 25.

- (3) HOW do you ensure that external CUSTOMERS understand and fulfill
their CYBERSECURITY roles and responsibilities? - (4) HOW do you manage internal andexternal CUSTOMER complaints about your CYBERSECURITY
policies and operations?

**Notes:**

**3.2.** Your results for customer perceptions and actions (outcomes)
should be reported in item 7.2.

**Q1.** Your approach to enabling customers to seek information and support
should include provisions to protect privacy and civil liberties when
personal information is used, collected, processed, maintained, or
disclosed in connection with your organization's cybersecurity
activities. Some examples of activities with privacy or civil liberties
considerations include cybersecurity activities that may result in the
overcollection or overretention of personal information; disclosure or
use of personal information unrelated to cybersecurity activities; and
cybersecurity mitigation activities that result in denial of service or
other similar potentially adverse impacts, including incident detection
or monitoring that may impact freedom of expression or association.

Privacy principles to consider incorporating in cybersecurity policies
and operations include minimizing the collection, disclosure, and
retention of personal information related to the cybersecurity incident
; use limitations outside of cybersecurity activities on any information
collected specifically for cybersecurity activities; transparency for
certain cybersecurity activities; individual consent and redress for
adverse impacts arising from use of personal information in
cybersecurity activities; data quality, integrity, and security; and
accountability and auditing.

# Evaluating Your Responses

#### 1. For each item (e. g., 1.1, 1.2) in categories 1 – 7 of the *Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder*, use the process and results rubrics on pages 24 – 25 to assign a descriptor (Reactive, Early, Mature, or Role Model) for each evaluation factor.

For processes (categories 1 – 6), the evaluation factors are approach,
deployment, learning, and integration (ADLI):

- *Approach* consists of the methods used to carry out a process, the
degree to which your approach is systematic (i. e., repeatable and
based on reliable data and information), the appropriateness of these
methods to the item questions and your operating environment, and the
effectiveness of your use of the methods.

- *Deployment* is the extent to which your approach is applied consistently
and the extent to which it is used by all appropriate work units.

- *Learning* is the refinement of your approach through cycles of evaluation
and improvement, the encouragement of breakthrough change to your
approach through innovation, and the sharing of refinements and
innovations with other relevant work units and processes in your
organization.

- *Integration* is the extent to which your approach is aligned with the
organizational needs identified in the Organizational Context section
and in other process items. Integration also includes the extent to
which your measures, information, and improvement systems are
complementary across processes and work units; and the extent to which
your plans, processes, results, analyses, learning, and actions are
harmonized across processes and work units to support organization-wide
goals.

For results (category 7), the evaluation factors are levels, trends,
comparisons, and integration (LeTCI; “ let's see ”).

- *Levels* are your current performance on a meaningful measurement scale.

- *Trends* are your rate of performance improvement or continuation of good performance in areas of importance (i.e., the slope of data points over time).


- *Comparisons* are your performance relative to that of other, appropriate organizations, such as competitors or organizations similar to yours, and your performance relative to industry leaders or relevant benchmarks.

- *Integration* is the extent to which your results address important performance requirements relating to customers, products / services, markets, processes, and action plans identified in the Organizational Context section and in the process items (categories 1 – 6). It also includes the extent to which your results reflect harmonization across your processes and work units to support organization-wide goals.

#### 2. Indicate the importance (high, medium, or low) of each item to the successful management of cybersecurity within your organization.

#### 3. Prioritize your actions.

Celebrate your strengths of your cybersecurity risk management program,
and build on them to improve what you do well. Sharing the things you
do well with the rest of your organization can speed improvement.

Prioritize your opportunities for improvement; you cannot do everything
at once. Think about what is most important for your organization as a
whole at this time, balancing the differing needs and expectations of
your stakeholders, and decide what to work on first. Look at the next
level in the rubric for how you might improve. Develop an action plan,
implement it, and measure your progress.
